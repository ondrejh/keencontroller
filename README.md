# keencontroller
arduino micro based keyboard (mame controller) suitable for commander keen

## status:
- button model (learning freecad)
- all possible inputs of arduino covered now
- basic arduino program with 3 keys

## next steps:
1) concept proof
2) model (learn freecad)

## concept proof:
\1) connect a few buttons to arduino micro .. done
\2) make it keyboarding .. done
3) can i do doublekey (y/t and n/d)?

## keys needed
arrows, ctrl, alt, esc, 1 - 9 (or at least some of those), y, n, d, t ...

## model
\1) button .. done
2) stick
3) body
